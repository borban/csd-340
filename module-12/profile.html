                <p>I currently work as a Software Engineer for a federal contractor CACI, Inc. The program I work for is
                    based in Scott Air Force Base in southern Illinois and is part of USTRANSCOM. This program is where
                    I initially made the switch from system administrator to software engineer and I have worked for
                    over
                    3 years on this program. Albeit on 3 separate tours. I enjoy working on software that directly
                    benefits members of the military and their families during a time when it might be most stressful.

                <p>I worked for 4 years total for Enterprise Holdings. Three years were spent working on their main
                    operations
                    application called ECARS. This is the software that all the branches for Enterprise, Alamo, and
                    National used for their daily rental operations. I spent one year working on the hourly rental
                    CarShare program that was placed in multiple large cities. I gained a lot of knowledge during the
                    four years with the company and was promoted from associate engineer to mid-level engineer in that
                    time.</p>

                <p>I worked for one year as a System Administrator at Savvis. This company was bought out by Centurylink
                    right before I moved on to work at USTRANSCOM. Savvis was a web hosting provider in direct
                    competition with the likes of Amazon Web Services and others. I was responsible for helping support
                    multiple Fortune 500 companies maintain their websites and provide multiple services such as
                    certificate management, packaging and deploying updates, and providing triage and remediation
                    services when sites had problems.</p>

                <p>Golf is a recent hobby I have picked up over the last few years. I find it to be both challenging and
                    relaxing at the same time. I grew up in more of a rural setting, so the courses allow me to enjoy
                    the landscapes and be in nature while the game challenges me mentally and physically.</p>

                <p>Since I was a young child, space as the final frontier always fascinated me. In part, my father and
                    grandfather helped build this interest through the constant talk of the space shuttle and NASA. I
                    keep watch on current industry advancements by reading articles, following Twitter, and also like to
                    watch launches. The recent news with the James Webb Telescope is absolutely stunning and I look
                    forward to all the scientific data that will come out from this first of it's kind observatory.</p>

                <p>Traveling is something that always made me feel alive. I think it is ingrained in me because my
                    father and his family were military brats and were always on the move and this wanderlust was passed
                    down to me. Although, I did not travel out of the country until I was in my 20's, I had done a good
                    amount of traveling domestically in the U.S. This is a hobby that I share with my wife, and as a
                    result, we went on a road-trip to the Grand Canyon as our honeymoon.</p>
